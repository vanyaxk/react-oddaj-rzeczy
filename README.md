## react-oddaj-rzeczy
My small React project

Technologies used: 

- React (react-components, react-scroll)
- Webpack

# In order to run, run these commands:

- npm i
- npm run build
- npm run start


In your browser, open http://localhost:3001/#/

If you would like to use login and registration options, you will have to install json-server to watch the user database:

- npm install -g json-server

then, in the same folder run this command: 

- json-server --watch js/database/users.json --port 3002
